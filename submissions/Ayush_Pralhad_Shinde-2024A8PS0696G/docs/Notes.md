Honestly it was easy task to do since I am second year student and already familiar with DD.

Still learnt about blocking and non-blocking. funny thing was I kept doing mistake of putting comma after initializing each input or output in each module and forgetting that last line shouldn't have comma. 



I just had random thoughts about other weird approaches to do this ( not following all instructions ) , one random approach is to make one big counter that starts at 0 and goes till 6000 for 100 mins and this is very easy to code in Verilog but then I thought we will need some crazy combinational logic ckt to calculate time/60 and time%60 soo it seems hard to make on hardware.
